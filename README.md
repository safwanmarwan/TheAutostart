# TheAutostart
This is an example to show how auto-starting android application can be achieved.

There are only 2 files involved in this demo, an android manifest file named [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/safwanmarwan/TheAutostart/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) and a `BroadcastReceiver` class file named [BootUpReceiver.java](https://github.com/safwanmarwan/TheAutostart/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/theautostart/BootUpReceiver.java).
